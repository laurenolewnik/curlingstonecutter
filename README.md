# curlingstonecookiecutter
This was my first 3d project! Woot! That's why the first file is aptly named "Learning the Moves." I was learning how to build this for 3d printing. 

Have fun making cut outs with this cookie cutter! 

Be social. If you use this pattern to make cookies for your curling club, tag #curling802 and at @RutlandRocksCurlingClub.
